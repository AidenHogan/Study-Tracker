# Study Tracker
A detailed study/time tracker with various data visualizations
# Focus & Wellness Tracker

A desktop application designed to help track study sessions and explore correlations between focus habits and personal wellness data, such as sleep.

## About The Project

This project was conceived as a tool to gain better insights into personal productivity. It allows a user to time their study sessions, tag them by subject, and view detailed analytics on their work habits. Furthermore, it integrates health data imported from Garmin Connect to visualize potential connections between sleep quality and study performance.

### AI Use Disclaimer

**This project was developed in collaboration with Google's AI, Gemini.** The concept, feature requirements, and debugging direction were provided by Aiden Hogan. The Python code, including the application structure, UI layout, data processing, and plotting logic, was generated by Gemini. This README serves to maintain transparency about the AI-assisted development process.

## Key Features

**Session Timer:** A simple stopwatch to time study sessions with subject tagging.
**Manual Entry:** Manually add or edit past study sessions with notes.
**Dashboard:** An at-a-glance view of today's focus, weekly totals, lifetime stats, and study streaks.
**Productivity Calendar:** A heatmap-style calendar that visualizes which days you studied and the subjects covered.
**In-Depth Analytics:**
    * Breakdown of time spent per subject (Pie Chart).
    * Productivity trends by day, hour, and day of the week (Bar Charts).
**Health Correlation:**
    * Import sleep and wellness data from a Garmin Connect CSV export, or manually track and enter sleep duration.
    * Visualize relationships between study time and metrics like Sleep Score, Sleep Duration, and Garmin's 'Body Battery'.
**Data Management:**
    * Create and manage custom tags with unique colors.
    * Ability to export all session and health data to CSV files for further analysis.

## Technologies Used

**Python**
**CustomTkinter:** For the graphical user interface (GUI).
**Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
**Matplotlib:** For creating charts and plots.
**SQLite:** For the local database.
**PyInstaller:** For packaging the application into an executable.
