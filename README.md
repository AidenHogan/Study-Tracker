# Study Tracker
A detailed study/time tracker with various data visualizations
# Focus & Wellness Tracker

A desktop application designed to help track study sessions and explore correlations between focus habits and personal wellness data, such as sleep.

## About The Project

This project was conceived as a tool to gain better insights into personal productivity. It allows a user to time their study sessions, tag them by subject, and view detailed analytics on their work habits. Furthermore, it integrates health data imported from Garmin Connect to visualize potential connections between sleep quality and study performance.

### AI Use Disclaimer

**This project was developed in collaboration with Google's AI, Gemini.** The concept, feature requirements, and debugging direction were provided by Aiden Hogan. The Python code, including the application structure, UI layout, data processing, and plotting logic, was generated by Gemini. This README serves to maintain transparency about the AI-assisted development process.

## Key Features

**Session Timer:** A simple stopwatch to time study sessions with subject tagging.
**Manual Entry:** Manually add or edit past study sessions with notes.
**Dashboard:** An at-a-glance view of today's focus, weekly totals, lifetime stats, and study streaks.
**Productivity Calendar:** A heatmap-style calendar that visualizes which days you studied and the subjects covered.
**In-Depth Analytics:**
    * Breakdown of time spent per subject (Pie Chart).
    * Productivity trends by day, hour, and day of the week (Bar Charts).
**Health Correlation:**
    * Import sleep and wellness data from a Garmin Connect CSV export, or manually track and enter sleep duration.
    * Visualize relationships between study time and metrics like Sleep Score, Sleep Duration, and Garmin's 'Body Battery'.
**Data Management:**
    * Create and manage custom tags with unique colors.
    * Ability to export all session and health data to CSV files for further analysis.

## Technologies Used

**Python**
**CustomTkinter:** For the graphical user interface (GUI).
**Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
**Matplotlib:** For creating charts and plots.
**SQLite:** For the local database.
**PyInstaller:** For packaging the application into an executable.

## Getting Started

### Executable Version (Recommended)

The easiest way to use the application is to download the `Focus_Tracker.exe` file from the latest [Releases](https://github.com/AidenHogan/repo-name/releases) page on this repository. No installation is needed.

### Running from Source

If you wish to run the project from its source code:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/AidenHogan/repo-name.git](https://github.com/AidenHogan/repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    # On Windows
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    python main_app.py
    ```

## Recent updates (Oct 2025)

Summary of notable fixes and new capabilities ready for push:

- Startup fix: Replaced a fragile CustomTkinter menu path with a standard `tkinter.Menu` in `main_app.py` to avoid a stack overflow crash on some Windows environments. The app now launches reliably in the packaged and development environments.
- Garmin OAuth1 support: Added an interactive sign-in helper and a menu entry (Garmin â†’ Sign in to Garmin (OAuth)) to obtain/persist an OAuth1-capable session so richer Garmin endpoints (DailyHydration, DailyIntensityMinutes, resting HR, SpO2, detailed body battery) can be accessed when you sign in.
- Database schema additions: New daily health columns were prepared in the importer/db code to accept `hydration_ml` and `intensity_minutes` (these will be populated after a successful OAuth1 sync). The importer accepts both `Date` and legacy `Bedtime` CSV headers.
- Weekly & rolling analysis: The correlation engine now includes weekly resampling and rolling-window feature engineering (week-level aggregates, 1/2/4-week rolling stats). Weekly analysis smoke-tested and returns model selection outputs.

Notes and next steps before an official release:

- OAuth1 runtime: To populate hydration and intensity automatically, sign in via the app menu and then run the Garmin sync. Accounts with 2FA may require a browser-based flow. If you prefer a CLI helper, see the `core/garmin_downloader` module.
- Additional persistence: The codebase prepares for storing more Garmin Daily* stats; I recommend committing the current changes and then adding the dedicated `garmin_daily_stats` table (or extra columns) in a follow-up PR to keep changes small and reviewable.
- Tests & docs: Unit tests and README sections for migrations and importer behavior will be added in a follow-up commit.
