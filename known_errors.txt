Event study, quantile reg, and ccf are all a little 

Let's add automatic descriptions for explanatory analytics

Add a confidence level in the data.  So say, we have 10 days recording 20 factors.
What's the confidence we can accurately predict anything from that (as a percent)
This is especially relevent for graphical stuff that appears to show 
correlation, but may be using really limited data


Dates are off in the factors tab.  Thought 26th was a saturday, but it's sunday


Make sure data is starting based on the first recorded day studying, not the first data point
we have.  Like, if factors go back a year, but the first time recorded studying was 4 weeks ago,
only consider data starting from 4 weeks ago.

Can only filter by category : school work
Need to allow for more robust filtering, based on users specific categories

Time by category day tab on the first analytics page (Piechart) displays: "Time by category" (desired) followed by "(.!ctktabview.ctkframe3." ... [ect])
