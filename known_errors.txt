Event study, quantile reg, and ccf are all a little 

Let's add automatic descriptions for explanatory analytics

Add a confidence level in the data.  So say, we have 10 days recording 20 factors.
What's the confidence we can accurately predict anything from that (as a percent)
This is especially relevent for graphical stuff that appears to show 
correlation, but may be using really limited data



Make sure data is starting based on the first recorded day studying, not the first data point
we have.  Like, if factors go back a year, but the first time recorded studying was 4 weeks ago,
only consider data starting from 4 weeks ago.

Can only filter by category : school work
Need to allow for more robust filtering, based on users specific categories

Time by category day tab on the first analytics page (Piechart) displays: "Time by category" (desired) followed by "(.!ctktabview.ctkframe3." ... [ect])

4th page of analytics tab is squished vertically

Imports ActivityWatch tags and merges them with user tags, which is annoying.  They should be seperate so as not to
flood user tags with unwanted stuff that's just for more detailed tracking.  

Page 4 analytics (all the data analysis and models) is blank!  From model overviews to CCF and Quantile and event studies!
