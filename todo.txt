Let's add automatic descriptions for explanatory analytics

(limited implementation so far)
Add a confidence level in the data.  So say, we have 10 days recording 20 factors.
What's the confidence we can accurately predict anything from that (as a percent)
This is especially relevent for graphical stuff that appears to show 
correlation, but may be using really limited data


Can only filter by category : school work
Need to allow for more robust filtering, based on users specific categories

What am I saying here????
Time by category day tab on the first analytics page (Piechart) displays: "Time by category" (desired) followed by "(.!ctktabview.ctkframe3." ... [ect])


4th page of analytics tab is squished vertically
